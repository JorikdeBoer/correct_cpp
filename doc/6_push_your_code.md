# 6. Push your code 

After having [done the exercise](5_do_the_exercise.md), 
push your code to let `git` upload your proposed solution.

On your local computer, use `git push` from the command-line to upload your code.
Before this, you also need to add and commit your proposed changes.

For example:

```
git add --all :/
git commit -m "My proposed changes"
git push
```

Your code is uploaded to your GitHub.

Now [correct your GitHub](7_correct_your_github.md).
