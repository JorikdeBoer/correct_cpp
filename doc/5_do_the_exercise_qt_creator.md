# 5. Do the exercise using Qt Creator

You can [do the exercise](5_do_the_exercise.md) using Qt Creator.

Each chapter has a Qt Creator project file with the name `main.pro` that you can just use.

Open that project file using Qt Creator.

If Qt Creator asks you to configure the project, click on 'Configure project'

Qt Creator will show you its first screen.

At the left, in the 'Project' section, click the drop-down arrow to view the first sections of the project.
Then click the drop-down arrow on 'Sources' to view the source files. Double-click on `main.cpp` to start editing.
